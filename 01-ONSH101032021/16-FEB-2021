jdbc api allows us to access the data from database interms of rows/columns using ResultSet object. We use the data that is returned in terms of ResultSet in java application to perform the operation.

try {
  double totalSales = 0;
  double paidAmount = 0;
  Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
  Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, un, pwd);
  Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from sales");
  while(rs.next()) {
    paidAmount = rs.getDouble("paid_amount");
    totalSales += totalSales;
  }
}finally {
  // close resources
}
We have 2 types of logics
1. Data access logic
2. Business logic

From the above code we have 4 problems.
In above code our business logic is reading the data directly from the source system so that our business logic is exposed to the source system and brings several problems
1. if we want to switch from one source system to another, we not only need to modify data access logic,even business logic also will be impacted
2. if we have multiple source systems from which we want to read the data and perform operation,then the business logic will be duplicated across all the source systems.
3. If we change the source system representation format of storing the data again business logic is impacted.
4. having the data access logic and business written together makes the code complex to understand and difficult to maintain.
  
class SalesDataAccessor {
  public ResultSet getSalesData() {
    try {
      Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, un, pwd);
      Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
      ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from sales");      
    }finally {
      // close resources
    }
    return rs;
  }
}

class SalesManager {
  public double getTotalSale() {
    SalesDataAccessor salesDataAccessor = new SalesDataAccessor();
    ResultSet rs = salesDataAccessor.getSalesData();
    while(rs.next()) {
      double paidAmount = rs.getDouble("paid_amount");
      totalSales +=paidAmount;
    }
    return paidAmount;
  }
}
