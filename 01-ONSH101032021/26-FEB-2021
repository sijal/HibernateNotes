one-to-one
a record of one table is in relationship with only one record of another table, then those tables are said to be in one-to-one relationship.
There are 2 ways of representing one-to-one relationship
  1. direct one-to-one relationship
  2. one-to-many as one-to-one relationship
  
#2 
one-to-many as one-to-one relationship.
If both the tables has independent identify (primary key columns), then we have to establish one-to-one relationship by representing one-to-many relationship between the tables and convert into one-to-one by making fk column as unique
