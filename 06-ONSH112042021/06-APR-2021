For each operation we perform, we create one object of connection/session as well and at the end of the operation we should close the connection/session. 
Never share connection/session object
  1. a connection/session object establishes a database session from the application and all the operations we do with the connection/session will be tracked and comitted by the database, so if we share the connection/session object it will result into transaction inconsistency
  2. if we share a connection/session between the classes, if any class closes the session/connection will results in loss of connection for all the other classes of our application
