What is SessionFactory and what is the purpose of it?
SessionFactory holds the configuration and mapping information using which we it creates the object of Session.

How many objects of the SessionFactory we should create for an application?
We should avoid creating multiple objects of the SessionFactory because
  1. it is an immutable object which holds configuration and mapping, would gets duplicated in jvm memory if we create multiple objects and waste jvm memory
  2. it hold connection pool to optimize the creation of Session object. so creating and closing the SessionFactory for an application multiple times will heavily impacts the performance of our application.
To avoid the above problems we should create only one Object of SessionFactory per one database in an application.

How to create only one object of SessionFactory per one database within an application?

class SessionFactoryRegistry {
  private static SessionFactory sessionFactory; // only one copy of the object is required
  
  // it executes only once
  static {
    Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure();
    sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory();
  }
  public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
    return sessionFactory;
  }
}

How many objects of the connection we need to create per an application?
Connection should not be a Singleton class, we should not share the connection object between multiple classes of our application. 
  
because a connection represents a session to the database and all the operation we do on database will be tracked based on Connection/Session we are holding, comit/rollback operation takes place based on the transactions we carried using the Connection object, sharing the same connection across multiple operations of our application results in inconsistency.
If a class closes a connection then the rest of the classes using the connection will be lost.

We should always create a connection per operation level and at the end-of the operation we should close connection to release the resource. 
  
similar to the above, even Session object should be create one per operation and should be closed at the end of the operation.
