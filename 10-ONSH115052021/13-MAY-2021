There are 2 types of hibernate tools are available
1. command-line tools 
These helps us in creating, updating or validating the database tables from mapping information
  1.1 SchemaExport = creating/dropping an existing database schema from the given mapping information
    - to recreate database tables from the application code across the developers of our team during development
    - during the time of running junit testcases we create and drop a test database
        
  1.2 SchemaUpdate = updating the existing database tables out of the mapping provided
    - to quickly reflect the code changes we made interms of entity classes onto the underlying database during development we use this tool
  
  1.3 SchemaValidate = verifies the mapping information of the application and the database tables are valid or not
    - before deploying and running the application, to ensure the code version and database schema are matching or not we will verify using this tool

These 3 tools are java classes which are shipped as part of hibernate libraries, to run a java class within a jar we need to set classpath pointing to jar and execute the main class.
Usually we apply these tools within a project, so lets start settingup a project with entity classes, mapping and configuration information, once we have these we can create tables out of it by using these tools.

How to run the tool
#1 create an env.bat in the project directory
#2 set 2 environment variables pointing as below
  - M2_REPO=pointing to maven repository location
  - HCP=pointing all the hibernate jars of our poject from M2_REPO

SchemaExport:-
  java -cp %HCP% org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport options mapping_files
  -- quite
  -- drop
  -- create
  -- text
  -- output=file
  --config=hibernate.cfg.xml
  --properties=hibernate.properties
  --format=true
  --delimeter=;
