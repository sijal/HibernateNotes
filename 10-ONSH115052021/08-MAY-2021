What is Jpa api, how to work with Jpa api?
Jpa standards Jakarta (Java) Persistence Api, it is used for working on ORM Technology as part of java language.
Jpa 2.0
  |-Hibernate 5/6

EntityManager:-
Equivalent to a Session class in Hibernate Framework in Jpa api we have EntityManager, how a Session object holds the connection and mapping information to perform persistency operation similary an EntityManager holds a database Connection and has Mapping Information within it with which it performs Persistency operation on underlying database  

Per operation we need to create one EntityManager similar to Session object in Hibernate Framework.
  
EntityManagerFactory:-
Equivalent to a SessionFactory class in Hibernate Framework, 
1. It acts as a Repository for holding mapping and configuration information in memory
2. It acts as an factory for creating the object of EntityManager
3. Based on the implementation vendor they can even maintain connection pool in optimizing the creation of Connection object

We should create one object of EntityManagerFactory for one database.

Persistence:-
Equivalent to a Configuration class, responsible reading the configuration and mapping information with which it creates the object of EntityManagerFactory.
  
  
We need to provide persistence configuration file and should be placed under META-INF directory under the classpath of your application directly, location is fixed and cannot be changed.
The name of the file must and should be persistence.xml only.

|-src
  |-main
    |-java
    |-resources
      |-META-INF
        |-persistence.xml
|-pom.xml

Unlike hibernate.cfg.xml having 1 per 1 database, we will have here only one persistence.xml irrespective of number of schemas/databases. To support multiple schemas/database we define persistence-unit per each database in persistence.xml.
  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<persistence>
  <persistence-unit name="vogopu">
    <provider>org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider</provider>
    <mapping-file></mapping-file>
    <properties>
      <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"/>
      <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hdbd"/>
      <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="root"/>
      <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="root"/>
      
      <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/>
      <property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dailect"/>
    </properties>
  </persistence-unit>  
</persistence>
