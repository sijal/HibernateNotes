Entity Relationship Mapping = it is about how to map entity classes with relationship between them into the underlying relational database relationship.  
An entity class can be in relationship with another entity class in 2 ways
  1. Inheritance
    reusing the data/functionality of a class in another class is called "Inheritance". When we establish inheritance relationship between the classes those classes are said to be in "IS-A" relationship and any of the subclass can be accessed through the reference of Super Class (Polymorphism).
  
  2. Association
    another form of reusing the data/functionality of a class in another class. an association relationship between classes is established by writing one class as an attribute inside another class, thus forming "HAS-A" relationship.
      
Entity Relationship mapping is about how to represent inheritance relationship or association relationship between entity classes into database relationships.
From the above we can derive 2 types of Entity Relationship Mappings.
1. Inheritance Mapping Model
2. Assocation Mapping Model
