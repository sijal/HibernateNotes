What is a composite primary key?
If we take a primary key with 2 or more columns within it then it is called Composite Primary Keys. We encounter composite primary key in 2 usecases
  1. while working on many-to-many relationships 
  2. when we are using natural columns as key columns then we might need to consider multiple columns in primary key column.
    
In hibernate configuration based mapping application we have 2 ways of mapping an composite primary key are there.
#1
 <composite-id>
  <key-property name="" column=""/>
  <key-property name="" column=""/>
 </composite-id>
 
#2    
 wrap key column into a pk class, which must and should implement from Serializable interface. declare pk class as attribute within our entity class and write mapping
  <composite-id name="guaratePk">
    <key-property name="" column=""/>
    <key-property name="" column=""/>
  </composite-id>
