How many types of collections are supported by Hibernate/Jpa Frameworks in modelling an one-to-many association between the entity classes?
They support 3 types of collections.
  1. Set
  2. List
  3. Map
  
#1 Set = if we want to store unique child objects for a given parent, then we choose Set collection.
#2 List = if we want to preserve insertion order of the child entity objects in retrieving them, then we use List based collection
#3 Map = if we want to store additional data out of the relationship will use Map.
  
class Member {

}
