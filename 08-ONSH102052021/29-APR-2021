Hibernate 5.0

Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
StandardServiceRegistryBuilder builder = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder().configure();
StandardServiceRegistry registry = builder.build();
SessionFactory sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory(registry);

In the above code the Configuration class doesnt hold any configuration, it just acts as a Factory for creating the object of SessionFactory by passing ServiceRegistry.

Previously we used to hold the hibernate configuration in memory within Configuration object, and used to modify the configuration programmatically as well. 
1. Because Configuration object here is empty, and any changes in Configuration object will not reflect while instantiating the SessionFactory, since all the configuration ServiceRegistry is being used directly.
2. ServiceRegistry is an ioc container but it doesnt allows us to modify the configuration programmatically.  
Finally there is no way in modifying or managing the metadata programmatically in hibernate 4  
To overcome the above problem hibernate 5 has introduced Metadata api with this we can avoid using Configuration class.
