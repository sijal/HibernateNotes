What is cascade, how to work on it?
When we perform the operation on parent object, how does it effect or propogate to the child object can be controlled through cascade option.
We can reduce the lines of code we write in perform the persistence operation on associations throught cascade option.
  
cascade:-
  none
  all
  save-update
  delete
  orphan-delete
  
<many-to-one name="member" column="member_no" class="Member" not-null="true" cacade="save-update"/>
  
  
Member member = new Member(); (inverse=true)
member.setMemberName("patrik");
member.setRole("developer");
member.setExperience(10);

Task task = new Task();
task.setTitle("Build javascript");
task.setDescription("UI Validations");
task.setDuration(3);
task.setMember(member);
session.save(task);
