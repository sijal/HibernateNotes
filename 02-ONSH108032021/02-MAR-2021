after gathering the business data as raw data, we need to store the data into relational database. Never store the data of a business in one single table always we need break the data and store in multiple tables.
Why we should break the data into multiple tables, why not we can store in one table itself?
If we store all the application/system/business data in one single table we will run into anomalies.
insertion anomalies
updation anomalies
deletion anomalies
